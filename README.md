Thematic collection of books
===============

I propose the development of a common core mobile application, using which you can publish similar applications, changing only the content database.
It is assumed that the thematic collection of books will be fully bezpplatnym.
The collection includes books can be a text (. Epub) and graphics (. Pdf) format.

These are the primary functional application.
---------------
The main view: In the main view a user is viewing the list of authors and / or the names included in the thematic collection.

Search: Full-text search across the text content is included in the collection

Catalog of mobile applications: This section will publish all available mobile applications Libraries are.

Integration with social networks: From the application will be able to send a message with a link to the application:
Facebook
Twitter
E-mail

Score application: Publication of a review in the appropriate app store
